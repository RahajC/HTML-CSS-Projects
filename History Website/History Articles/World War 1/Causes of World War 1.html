    <h1>World War 1</h1>
    <h2>Causes of World War 1</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>To understand why World War 1 occured, we must learn about the poltical situation in Europe prior to World War 1 and how it 
       lead to World War 1. One thing to mention is that, the poltical situation was not the only factor but rather there were a multitude of 
       factors which lead Europe to a catastrophic conflict, later to be known as World War 1. Before The Great War, many European
       countries colonized different countries around the world, namely Britan, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Italy. They had 
       colonies nearly all across the world. With these countries extracting resources around the globe and expanding their empire, it did 
       not sit well with other European Countries such as Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary at the time, as they also wanted to expand their
       country. Colonization was not the only cause of The Great War but it was certainly the leading factor as this is what set off the
       conflict in 1914, as it will be later explained. There were also other factors which lead to World War 1 such as the Arms race, nationalism,
       and lastly alliances between the different European nations. 

       To summarize, historians consider 4 factors which lead to The Great War, which are:
         <ul>
           <li>Imperalism and Colonization</li>
           <li>Alliances between European Nations</li> 
           <li>Arms Race</li>
           <li>Nationalism</li>
         </ul>  
       All of these factors will be explained throughly throughout this article. </p>
     <h3>Imperalism and Colonization</h3>
     <p>It is well known that super powers of each era have a desire to conqueor and rule different nations to benefit their own country and also to advance
        their own interests. It is difficult to name a super power of each era which did not attempt to rule over other nations. For example, the Arabs in the
        Arabian peninsula ruled over Presia, Eygpt, North Africa and at one point modern day Spain as well during the year 800. The Mongols conqueored and ruled
        over the entirety of Asia and parts of the Balkans, later to be known as the largest Empire known to humankind. So it comes to no surprise that when major
        European powers such as Spain, England, France and more were able to colonize and rule over weaker nations, they too also set out to colonize different 
        nations and advance their interests. However, imperalism started to become an issue in the late 1800s when Germany, Russia and Austria-Hungary started to 
        grow in terms of economy and wanted to pursue foriegn interests overseas. Germany in particular wanted to expand overseas and colonize different nations. 
        The problem was that many or rather all of these colonies were already colonized by major European superpowers at the time such as Britan, France and Italy 
        especially the African region, where it was flourishing with resources. Germany's interested in imperalism caused problems with Eurpean superpowers, especially
        Britan, as they were declining in strengh while Germany was increasing rapidly. The tension between Germany and Britan caused problems because as one can see,
        if Germany wanted to expand their empire, they would have to fight other superpowers such as France or England, to advance their interests. Of course, a conflict
        with any superpower would bring forth much destruction. Therefore, Germany and Britan tried to come to terms through diplomatic means such as Britan offering Germany
        some of their African colonies or other than that. However, this did not satisfy Germany and it only brought more tension as Germany decided to increase in their Arms
        and build warships in the early 1900s which caused much worry between the European superpowers. Although, Germany was not able to acquire many colonies outside of Europe,
        it is important to note that the political situation in the Austria-Hungarian Empire with Bosnia and Serbia which Germany saw this as an opportunity to advance their
        colonial interests. However, this was not the case due to mutual alliances between European nations which eventually led to an all out war. 
         </p>
     <h3>Alliances</h3>
     <p>Historians also comment on the fact that alliances between European superpowers is what brought this destructive conflict to Europe in the first place. However, 
        were not always the reason for the cause of conflicts, in fact, alliances between superpowers were quite common in Europe starting around 1814 - 1815. Alliances
        between Britan, Prussia, Austria and Russia (around the early 1800s) is what kept peace and diplomacy in the European continent. Alliances were also created to 
        ensure there was stability and security, for example, in the year 1858, superpowers such as Austria and Britan were worried about the growth of France and that
        France might wage war against these nations so they formed an alliance along with Russia and Prussia to prepare themselves for war, if need be. However, the 
        alliances in the year 1914 could not stop a catastrophic war in Europe, which became one of the worst conflicts known to mankind. Some of the reasons for this 
        includes alliances working together for their own interests and military power. Another, reason which brought The Great War through alliances include 
        political issues between the different alliances. The two lists below include the different nations that were involved in World War 1 at the start.</p>
        
     <p>Triple Alliance:                                   
          <ul>                                              
           <li>Germany</li>                                    
           <li>Austria-Hungary Empire</li>                   
           <li>Italy</li>                                      
         </ul> 
                                                
       Triple Entente:
          <ul>                                                                                   
           <li>Britan</li>
           <li>Russia</li> 
           <li>France</li>
         </ul>                                
       </p>
     <p>One thing to note is that although Italy was apart of the alliance, Italy decided to remain neutral throughout the war. Another thing to note, other nations joined
        the war after the war started, not initially such as the United States of America.
        
        Although, much could be said about this subject, the list below will give you a summary of how these alliances created World War 1.
          <ul>
           <li>Serbia's Nationalistic Group called Black Hand asassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who was heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary Empire</li>
           <li>Russia and Austria-Hungary were protector's of Serbia but this incident resulted in Austria-Hungary asking for Germany's support, which of course happened</li> 
           <li>As Russia began to prepare for war, Germany knew France would come to Russia's aid therefore, Germany declared war on both Russia and France but decided to
               attack France first, to wipe them off the map before Russia was ready to wage war.</li>
           <li>Germany crossed into Belgium's border to invade France and this resulted in Belgium seeking aid from Britan to protect Belgium from Germany</li>
         </ul>   
       And the rest is history. </p>
     <h3>Arms Race and Militarism</h3>
     <p>Arms Race and Militarism might sound like similar terms, however, they both have their own unique definitions, although it is hard to define militarism as the definition
        of militarism is different for every society and era. In the context of the 1914 war, one can see how militarism affected British and German society and one can also see
        how patriotism and militarism are linked together. While there is no official definition of militarism, one can define militarism as a society who values military thinking
        as their primary value and has a desire to expand and rule over other nations, regardless if they are weak or strong nations. Although, this is not an official definition,
        this theme is certainly recurring prior to 1914, especially in Germany. As previously mentioned before, Germany had an interest to colonize different parts of the globe. The
        German government promoted militarism in society by showcasing military uniforms in public schools and glorifying fighting for their country in the media. The government was 
        also increasing the strength of their naval army, which worried Britan and France. Along with Germany, Russia was also militarizing their society by ruling over large land 
        masses. However, they were not only militarizing society through land mass but also increasing in arms, such as infantry and technological warfare advancement. Russia was not 
        the only country trying to increase their arms, countries such as Britan, France and Germany were also working hard to increase their military strength and arms race, however
        Russia was ahead of those countries. As a result of militarism, this brought on the arms which ultimately lead to World War 1. To define arms race, arms race is the process of 
        a nation acquiring weaponry and advancing in technological warfare. This was the case for much of Europe, prior to 1914. Countries such as Britan, France, Germany and Russia were
        striving to acquire different types of weaponry such as warefare airplanes, machine guns, tanks etc. The new warfare is what also made World War 1 and World War 2, the worst conflict
        known to mankind. </p>
     <h3>Nationalism</h3>
     <p>Nationalism was one of the leading factors in the creation of World War 1, in fact one could say Nationalism is what started off World War 1 in the first place. One could say Nationalism
        first started off in the French Revolution and then spread all throughout Europe. In fact Nationalism was so effective and strong, that it created 2 new states in Europe, Germany and Italy.
        However, with all things, there are also cons and Nationalism is no exception. Although, there may have brought alot of prosperity and freedom through Nationalism, it also created alot of
        strife between people and governments, especially in the Balkans area. When the Ottoman Empire began to decline in power, they lost their possessions of the Balkans area such as Bosnia and 
        Serbia. Austria - Hungary, a growing imperial force, had an interest in ruling over the Balkans. As with any superpower, Austria - Hungary Empire began to occupy Bosnia with their troops and 
        this of course did not make the Slavic people happy, especially, the Christian population in Bosnia. As Austria-Hungary began to occupy Bosnia, a growing Serbian Christian nationalistic 
        movement was growing and this also affected the Christian population of Bosnia. Prior to the nationalistic movement, Serbia expanded greatly after the Balkan wars and they had a desire to 
        expand into Bosnia. The Christian nationalistic movement which was growing was called the Black Hand and they did not like the fact that Austria-Hungary was occupying Bosnia. Therefore, to rebel
        against this, they decided to a fix a bomb in the car of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary Empire. This resulted in his assassination which led to World War 1. </p>

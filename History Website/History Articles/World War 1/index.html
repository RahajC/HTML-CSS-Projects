    <h1>World War 1</h1>
    <h2>Before Getting Started</h2>
    <p class="one"> It is said that "History is written by the victors" and this is mostly true. Whenever you read any literature on history, you will
        usually read it in the perspective of the victor. With that being said, these posts and future posts will try to keep a balanced 
        academic approach on writing historical events. These articles are not written to justify wrongdoing and injustices comitted in 
        the past, but rather it is to read it from both perspectives and to understand why these events came about. </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p class="two"> The first world war was known as World War 1 or The Great War. It started on July of 1914 and ended on November of 1918. World War 1 
        was one of the worst conflicts in human history. The conflicted resulted in roughly 17 million casualties from hunger, proverty and
        warfare. One of the reasons World War 1 was a horrofic conflict was because of the new technology founded in that era. The new 
        technology brought more destruction, resulting in more casualties. This deadly conflict was a result of Germany, Ottoman Empire
        (Modern day Turkey), Bulgaria, Austria-Hungary (These nations were known as the Central Powers) waging war against Britan, France, 
        Russia, Italy, Romania, United States of America, and Japan (They were known as the Allied Powers). To understand the reasons behind
        World War 1 and how it has impacted today's world, we need to go back many years before the war started to see how this deadly conflict
        came to be.  </p>

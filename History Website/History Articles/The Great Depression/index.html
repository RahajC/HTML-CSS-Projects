    <h1>The Great Depression</h1>
    <h2>Before Getting Started</h2>
    <p> It is said that "History is written by the victors" and this is mostly true. Whenever you read any literature on history, you will
        usually read it in the perspective of the victor. With that being said, these posts and future posts will try to keep a balanced 
        academic approach on writing historical events. These articles are not written to justify wrongdoing and injustices comitted in 
        the past, but rather it is to read it from both perspectives and to understand why these events came about. </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p> The Great Depression is one of the most conflicting and disturbing events to have occurred throughout history. While scholars have debated 
        how many factors caused The Great Depression, they all agree on the fact that it started after Black Thursday, otherwise known as The Great Crash.
        Both The Great Crash and The Great Depression are two seperate events but they are linked together. The Great Crash involves the crash of the stock
        market, after investors began to sell all or most of their shares after seeing the stock price drop rapidly, eventually leading to the crash of the
        stock market. This in turn, lead to The Great Depression as the economic situation in America and around the world began to decline which lead to
        decline in standard of living, so much so that, people had to wait in line for bread. Some folks left their towns to look for work, while farmers
        were not able to pay off their bills.   </p>

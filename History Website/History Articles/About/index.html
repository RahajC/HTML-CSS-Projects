        <p> This site will be used to write articles about different historical events. As this is my first ever blog, I'm not sure where this blog will go nor am I sure how to design this
         blog accordingly. There will be much change coming towards this website in the near future as I continuously add content to this website and as I restructure the website itself. However, 
         for now I will be writing blog posts about expansion of different empires such as the Roman Empire, the Mongol Dynasty etc. I will also writing 
         articles about historical events such as World War 1 and World War 2 and how those wars have impacted our world. Of course, I will also be providing the resources and references 
         I used to create this posts. I will also add that most of my posts will not have my own opinion as I'm not qualified to do so, I will simply be summarizing and writing about the 
         different historical events that took place. I hope you enjoy reading my posts and I also hope you join my journey of learning history with me. Take care of yourself. </p>
